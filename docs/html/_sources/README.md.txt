# Environmental Source Apportionment Toolkit (ESAT)
Last Update: 02-26-2024

## Summary

### PMF5
The EPAâ€™s Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) Model is a mathematical tool that processes a dataset of feature concentrations across many samples (and concentration uncertainties) to estimate a set of sources and their contributions. PMF5 can be used on a wide range of environmental data and is a powerful tool for estimating source apportionment: https://www.epa.gov/air-research/positive-matrix-factorization-model-environmental-data-analyses

PMF version 5 was released in 2014 and is no longer being supported. PMF5 still has an active, international user community; making the development of a modern replacement a worthwhile effort. The primary goals for a PMF5 replacement would be to develop and release an open-source tool that replicates the functionality of PMF5 while also providing new data analytics features and techniques.

### ESAT
The EPA's Environmental Source Apportionment Toolkit (ESAT) project provides an open-source python package with which
source apportionment workflows can be programmatically created and run. The features available in the ESAT package
include data preprocessing and cleaning, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithms (currently two options are
available), solution analytics and visualizations, error estimation methods, and customized constrained factorization models.
These features reproduce and expand upon what is found in EPA's PMF5 application, which is no longer being updated
or maintained.

ESAT python package focuses on source apportionment estimates using NMF algorithms. These
algorithms are implemented both in python using numpy functions as well as in Rust for an optimization option. The
two currently available are:
 1. LS-NMF: Least-squares NMF, a well documented and widely uses NMF algorithm. The ls-nmf algorithm is available in the NMF R package.

 2. WS-NMF: Weight-Semi NMF, a variant of the NMF algorithm which allows for negative values in both the input data matrix and in the factor contribution matrix.

Source apportionment solution error estimation methods are also available, which are the same methods that are found in PMF5.
These are:
 1. Bootstrap (BS): the input dataset is divided into multiple blocks and randomly reassembled to attempt to quantify the variability in the factor profiles and contributions.

 2. Displacement (DISP): the solution factor profiles are all individually shifted (both increased and decreased) to determine the amount of change required for the loss value to reach specific dQ (change in Q) values.

 3. Bootstrap-Displacement (BS-DISP): the combination of the two error estimation methods. Where for each Bootstrap dataset/model, all or targeted factor profile values are adjusted using the DISP method.

Lastly, constrained models are able to be created where the user can define constraints and expressions which set or limit specific factor elements (single values from either the factor profile or factor contribution matrices), or define correlations between factor elements as linear expressions.

### Notebooks
Code examples are available in the repository jupyter notebooks, which also provided detailed algorithm documentation and complete workflow examples.

## Requirements
Python = 3.12\
numpy >= 1.24\
pandas >= 2.0.0\
plotly >= 5.14\
scipy >= 1.10

### Rust Requirements
The python package includes a Rust module for running the algorithm update procedures, which requires local compiling to execute.

To run the Rust functions that is specified by the optimized parameter, requires that Rust is installed (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and the python package maturin (https://pypi.org/project/maturin/) is installed to the py env. 
Then using the py env and from the project root running <i>maturin develop</i> or <i>maturin build</i> to compile the Rust functions to run from the python code. To compile the optimized Rust functions, add the <i>-r</i> or <i>--release</i> tags to compile with optimization.

The rust functions are imported as python functions, under nmf_pyr.

### Creating Docs
The documentation is created using sphinx and several extensions.

If creating or adding new rst files run <i>sphinx-apidoc -o docs src</i>.

To create, update or modify the existing documentation html, run 
<i>sphinx-build -M html . docs</i> from the command line at the project root directory running the python environment with the necessary sphinx packages.
