    "### Factor Identification Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The following set of functions are to test how well the algorithms (PMF, LS-NMF, WS-NMF) are able to capture the factor/source contributions to the input data set by generating simulated data for each factor and providing the product dataset to the algorithms. The outputs are reviewed and compared to the original 'true' factor matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulated datasets are generated by specifying the number of factors/sources (k), the number of features (m), the number of samples (n), the min and max % of noise to be applied to the input dataset, and the min and max % uncertainty to be used to create the uncertainty dataset. The pre-processing steps include: \n",
    "1. For each feature, select at random which factors contribute.\n",
    "2. Each factor that contributes determine the ratio of contribution for those factors.\n",
    "3. Based upon the ratio, create a concentration amount for each factor/feature.\n",
    "4. Input dataset is created by summing all factor matrices together and adding random noise between min_noise_p (%) and max_noise_p (%), for each cell in the input dataset.\n",
    "5. Calcualte the uncertainty dataset from a random value between min_uncertainty_p (%) and max_uncertainty_p (%) for each cell in the input dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs are compared by checking factor mapping $R^2$ and the resulting time-series $R^2$."
