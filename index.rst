The NMF-PY project is intended to replicate and expand upon the functionality of the EPA's PMF5 tool. The NMF-PY project will focus on open-source code written in Python using well known packages, such as Numpy and Pandas.
The expected code products from the project include:

1. Python package (available on pypi.org)
2. Collection of Jupyter Notebooks (python code) as both tutorials and allowing users to use their own data in the notebooks.
3. Web application with similar features found in the PMF5 application.
